As a frontend developer I have always thought that my designs were missing something. Loading screens just didn't ever line up with how I pictured them in my mind. I tried everyhting, loading bars, spinners, inspirational messages with themed backgrounds but it still didn't seem right.

But one faithful day while I was reading articles on the intertubular speedway of information (the internet) I came across [this article about skeleton screen](https://uxdesign.cc/what-you-should-know-about-skeleton-screens-a820c45a571a) and boyo did it change how I saw and understood loading screens. Here's my favorite part

> *Skeleton screens (as splash screens), when used to indicate that a screen is loading, are perceived as being shorter in duration when compared against a blank screen (our control) and a spinnerâ€Šâ€”â€Šbut not by much*

Isn't that something? So I began incorporating them into my design and what do you know, things just started to line up. My designs felt more performant and best of all: no longer was there awkward margin- / padding-issues when a screen was finished loading!

Aaaand what do we say to that, well ðŸ¦„ðŸ¦„ðŸ¦„

But there was still one problem, I could not find a React-package that was not giving me unforeseen headaches. So I thought, *why not make my own?* So, with 38 lines of breathtaking code and the all powerful package [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components), I did

```
import React from 'react';
import styled, { keyframes } from 'styled-components';

const fade = keyframes`
    0% {
        background-position: -200px 0;
    }
    100% {
        background-position: calc(200px + 100%) 0;
    }
`;

const Wave = styled.div`
    animation: ${fade} 2s ease-in-out infinite;
    background-color: ${props => props.baseColor};
    background-image: linear-gradient(
        90deg, 
        ${props => props.baseColor},
        ${props => props.shineColor},
        ${props => props.baseColor}
    );
    background-size: 200px 100%;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
`;

export default function Skeleton({
    style = { height: '100%', width: '100%', borderRadius: 5 },
    baseColor = '#f4f4f4',
    shineColor = '#e5e5e5',
}) {
    return (
        <Wave
            style={style}
            baseColor={baseColor}
            shineColor={shineColor}
        />
    );
}
```

Then to prove its ðŸ¦„ (read awesomeness) I wrote an implentation with [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html). To see it working in action go to my [sandbox page for it](https://codesandbox.io/s/pjmwrpo47x) and use it!
